This directory contains samples of problems I've attacked on Codefights.

Codefights is a website for programmers who want to compete with other programmers, hone their skills, or just do it for fun.  I've been using it to practice and demonstrate my skills in order to find a software engineering job.  I've been solving "Challenges", algorithmic programming tasks intended to keep you sharp.

This code does not contain tests because Codefights Challenges test your submitted code automatically.
